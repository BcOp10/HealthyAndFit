# Healthy and Fit


This application is meant to count the total number of calories a user consumes. It allows users to input a food name, the numbers of calories associated with that food, and the mealtime (This can be breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, or a specific time of day e.g., 11:30 AM). The user can also remove a specific food they ate and the total number of calories will be relfected instantly. To understand how the application works there are instructions and a video demonstration below.
